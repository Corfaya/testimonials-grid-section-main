## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I'm really proud of all my semantic HTML markup. In fact, I used to only use <div> elements to group elements, but in this other way the entire HTML was more readable and I completed this challenge in at least half the time it usually takes. Therefore, I'm pretty sure that using semantic HTML5 markup has helped me in this respect. Furthermore, I think it's also correct to write in this way for other developers who want to read my code.

I learnt a new CSS property that saved my work on mobile:

```css
.property-to-give-thanks-to {
  word-break: break-all;
}
```

I couldn't understand WHY the text came out of the boxes, despite the fact that I had set up a 'display: grid' that seemed to solve this problem by itself.

P.S. I'm pretty sure there's a way (perhaps within the logic of grid (?)) to prevent the text from overflowing, but, well... I found another way and learned something new. And that's a good thing, isn't it?

### Continued development

I'd like to continue focusing on the use of grid layout.
When I practise recreating web pages, flexbox is always my bff (ðŸ˜ƒ) and so I avoid using grid most of the time. I chose this challenge 'cause at a glance it seemed perfect for testing what I've learnt from grid. I will try to do more in the future.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://imagecolorpicker.com/) - This helped me find colours for the borders of the avatars.
- [Resource 2](https://www.iloveimg.com/resize-image#resize-options,pixels) - This helped me to resize the images maintaining aspect ratio.
- [Resource 3](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mobile-simulator-responsi/ckejmhbmlajgoklhgbapkiccekfoccmk?hl=it) - This Chrome extension allows me to better test the site on different mobile devices.
